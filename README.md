Step into the chilling atmosphere of classic Resident Evil right from your Police HQ. This mod replaces the default headquarters music in Ready or Not with a handpicked collection of iconic tracks from Resident Evil save rooms.

Whether you‚Äôre prepping for your next operation or enjoying the brief calm before the chaos, these unforgettable themes bring a sense of tension, nostalgia, and quiet unease ‚Äî perfect for fans of survival horror.

## Included Tracks:

RE1 Remake ‚Äì Save Room Theme
RE2 Classic ‚Äì Save Room Theme
RE4 Classic ‚Äì  Save Room Theme

## Audio Editing:

All tracks were manually edited using Audacity for smooth integration into the game‚Äôs ambient system. This included:

Loop-optimized cuts for seamless playback
Custom fade-outs and transitions
Volume and EQ balancing to match the game‚Äôs audio profile
These edits ensure each track blends naturally with Ready or Not‚Äôs tone while maintaining the emotional weight and atmosphere of the original compositions.

## Limitations:

Due to current in-game limitations in how music is triggered and rotated within the Police HQ environment ‚Äî where only around three tracks tend to play at a time, often repeating in no consistent order ‚Äî it's not currently possible to experience the full collection in a single session. So that's why I made 1 song playing at a time files, allowing you to choose your preferred track manually. If future updates expand the game‚Äôs audio system to support a more dynamic or extensive playlist, I‚Äôll gladly update this mod to take full advantage of those improvements.
